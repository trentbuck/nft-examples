#### This -*-nftables-*- ruleset is my /etc/nftables.conf for new hosts.
#### Ref. http://jengelh.medozas.de/documents/Perfect_Ruleset.pdf
#### Ref. https://wiki.nftables.org/
####
#### GOTCHA: This is written for nft 0.9.1.
####         Several options have changed, even since 0.9.0!
####
#### GOTCHA: "nft --file" does not flush by default.
####         That is, it acts like "iptables-restore --noflush".
####
#### GOTCHA: If your ruleset does "flush; add; flush; add",
####         it will actually do  "flush; flush; add; add".
####         That is, all the flushes move to the top.
####
####         This makes it impossible to do my old trick of
####         having the ruleset start with a "deny all" policy,
####         which was useful to make sure that if the firewall failed,
####         the OS would lock down the whole system.
####         (See "iptab" for notes about that.)
####
####         To achieve that under nft, you instead need to patch
####         nftables.service to have
####         OnFailure=nftables-denyall.service, and then write that
####         unit to load a SEPARATE, DIFFERENT nftables file that
####         blocks everything.  And even then, it won't behave quite
####         the same.
####
####         This also means it is no longer safe to refer to
####         hostnames in this ruleset, safe in the knowledge that
####         they can only be resolved via local /etc/hosts.  Because
####         the "deny all" ruleset can't be prepended here, we CANNOT
####         be sure the real ruleset will only resolve hostnames via
####         local sources -- so you might add ones that are only in
####         DNS, and then have the firewall fail to load during early
####         boot -- leaving you with a "working" host, with no
####         firewall!
####
#### GOTCHA: "list ruleset" here will print the ruleset BEFORE it goes through the kernel;
####         "nft list ruleset" later will print the ruleset AFTER it goes through the kernel.
####         The difference is usually like "iptables -p tcp" getting an implied "-m tcp".
####         However, differences MIGHT indicate a bug!  Watch out!
####
#### GOTCHA: "table filter" and "chain INPUT" or "chain input" just
####         conventions and have NO MEANING WHATSOEVER.  The actual
####         meaning comes from the "type filter hook input priority
####         filter" line.
####
#### NOTE: Only create a chain if you use it.
####       An empty chain is slightly slower than no chain at all.
####       e.g. most hosts don't need an output chain.
####
#### NOTE: iptables ALWAYS counts how many packets/bytes hit every chain and rule.
####       nftables makes this OPT IN, e.g. change "accept" to "counter accept".
####       iptables-save -c would print "[pkts:bytes] -A ...".
####       nftables list rulset will print "... counter packgets 12 bytes 34 ...".
####
####       Since counters are useful during debugging but not production,
####       I have left them out of this example.
####
#### NOTE: "table x" is implicitly "table ip x", which is IPv4 only.
####       If you want dual-stack, say "table inet x".
####
#### NOTE: "iif lo" is resolved at ruleset load time into an interface
####       NUMBER inside the kernel; whereas "iifname lo" remains a
####       string.  This means that:
####
####        * "iifname" is ~10 times slower than "iif" for every
####          packet considered (strcmp versus ==).
####
####        * If you load a ruleset with "iif foo" before foo exists,
####          the load will fail, LEAVING YOU UNPROTECTED!
####
####        * If you load a ruleset with "iif foo" and then foo is
####          removed and readded (e.g. ppp0 for a flaky ADSL link),
####          what happens?
####
####        * Rule of thumb: always use "iifname" (not "iif").


# NOTE: this will remove *ALL* tables --- including tables set up by
#       other things (e.g. sshguard)!
#
#       In theory you can flush just your own rules, e.g.
#
#           flush table inet my_filter
#
# FIXME: I tried that, and I got locked out of SSH!
#        What it did was remove all the rules, but NOT the chains, so
#        the default-deny policy dropped EVERYTHING!!!

        ##FOR "router" EXAMPLE### NOTE: a single rule CAN match "allow 53/tcp and 53/udp", but it's UGLY, so we don't.
        ##FOR "router" EXAMPLE### NOTE: I assume you used systemd (networkd or udev) to rename "enp0s0f0" to "lan".
        ##FOR "router" EXAMPLE### NOTE: "iif foo" must exist at ruleset load time.
        ##FOR "router" EXAMPLE###       If your ruleset starts BEFORE udev and/or systemd-networkd are READY=1,
        ##FOR "router" EXAMPLE###       consider using 'iifname lan' instead of "iif lan".
